Example 2:

Input:
N = 5
Arr[] = {1,2,3,4,5}
X = 5
Output: 4
Explanation: For array elements 
{1,2,3,4,5} element to be searched 
is 5 and it is at index 4. So, the 
output is 4.
Your Task:
The task is to complete the function search() which takes the array arr[], its size N and the element X as inputs and returns the index of first occurrence of X in the given array. If the element X does not exist in the array, the function should return -1.

Expected Time Complexity: O(N).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1). 

Constraints:
1 <= N <= 100
1 <= Arr[i] <= 100
1 <= X <= 100




int search(int arr[], int N, int X)
{
    
    // Your code here
    for(int i=0;i<N;i++){
    if(X==arr[i])
        {
            return i;
        }
        
    }
    return -1;
    
}
